# Jupyter Notebook on Traversing a Decision Tree

This project takes mock decision tree data revolving around choosing a drink at Starbucks.  The notebooks include importing data, traversing the tree, and determining what drink is chosen based on decisions in the tree.

## Getting Started

* **Install Python**
    * Python was used to execute commands within the Jupyter notebooks
    * [Download Python 3.7.1 Here](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-371/)
    * Follow the instructions to install Python on your machine
* **Install Neo4J Desktop Graph Database**
    * The data used in this project will be imported and analyzed with Neo4J Desktop Graph Database
    * [Download Neo4J Desktop Here](https://neo4j.com/download/)
    * Make sure to take note of the login information for your database server.  The default credentials are `neoj4/neo4j`
    * Create a graph within Neo4j Desktop.  If you are unsure how to do this, please [Follow the Directions Provided by Neo4J](https://neo4j.com/developer/neo4j-desktop/#_creating_a_graph_database)
* **Install Python Modules**
    * Navigate to the local folder within your computers terminal or console window (i.e. `> cd /path/to/jupyter-elections-graph-analysis`)
    * Run the python module install script `pip install -r requirements.txt`
* **Start Jupyter**
    * Simply run the command `jupyter notebook` within the ptoject root directory.
    * This should open a web browser and navigate to the Jupyter Notebook.  If a web browser does not open, you should be able to access the notebook web interface at `http://localhost:8888`
